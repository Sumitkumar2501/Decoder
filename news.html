   <div> Bowenpolly market in hyderabad:-
This Vegetable market is using waste to generate electricity and save lakhs of rupees every year. This vegetable market produces 10,000kgs of waste every single year. But instead of dumping all this waste in landfills,they have found genius way to convert it into electricity. Market authority installed the biogas plant in which the small piece of waste are placed and then converted into biofuel. This station produces 500 units of electricity every single day and power more than 100 street lights, 170 stalls and government building. The best part, it has even half the electricity bill of the market now. 
THIS IS PERFECT EXAMPLE OF NECCESITY MEETS INNOVATION.

    Chennai was among the first cities globally to adopt the technology in a big way when the municipality commissioned 1000 km of plastic roads in 2004.[16] The first plastic road in Tamil Nadu was laid down in Kambainallur, a Panchayat Town of the Dharmapuri district as per the guidelines of then Chief Minister. Since then all major municipalities in India have experimented with the technology including Pune, Mumbai, Surat, Indore, Delhi, Lucknow, etc.[17]

Chennai: While plastic roads may be a new concept in many parts of India, Chennai has been experimenting with them since 2011. Chennai has used nearly 1,600 tonnes of plastic waste to construct 1,035.23 kilometres length of roads in recent years, which include N.S.C Bose road, Halls road, Ethiraj Silai Street and Sardar Patel Street.

Pune: Using bitumen technology on waste plastic, the Pune Municipal Corporation constructed a 150-metre stretch of Bhagwat lane at Navi Peth near Vaikunth Crematorium in 2016. The other trial patches in Pune include Dattawadi Kaka Halwai Lane, Katraj Dairy, Magarpatta City HCMTR Road, Kavade Mala Road, Koregaon Park Lane No 3 and Yerawada Shadal Baba Darga Road from Chandrama Chowk.

Jamshedpur: Jamshedpur Utility and Services Company (JUSCO), which is a subsidiary company of Tata Steel, constructed a 12â€“15 km road in the steel city, as well as Tata Steel Works using plastic road, including a nearly 1 km stretch in Ranchi, 500m stretch each in Dhurwa and Morabadi, 3 km of roads in Chas and Jamtara each and 500m stretch in Giridih.

Indore: Dating 2014, the Madhya Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority (MPRRDA) has constructed around 35 km of roads in 17 districts with plastic waste.[17]

Surat: The idea of using plastic-bitumen mix was executed in January 2017. The problem of potholes significantly reduced as no cracks developed in areas where roads were layered with waste plastic.[18]

The technology has penetrated deeply and has found application even in far flung areas such as Meghalaya, where a village converted 430 kg of plastic waste into a kilometer long road in 2018.[19]

In December 2019, India built 21,000 miles of roads using plastic waste. Until now, the country has almost 33,700 km of plastic roadways that means every 1 km road uses one million plastic bags.[20] As of 2021, only 703 kilometers of National Highways were constructed using plastic roads.[21]
